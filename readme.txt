This is a basic theme that can be used for development of Wordpress themes.

It's ready to go for SASS/Compass and has a responsive menu. 

If I add/alter this folder I'll update this file with date and changes.

The theme really only consists of bits that I really use over and over. I've borrowed a couple things from Underscores that allow Jetpack and threaded comments to work out-of-the-box.

I've added the container class to the body which sets the stage for Skeleton to do it's thing.
